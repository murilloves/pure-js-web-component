# Pure JS Web Component

"A pure js web component, if you don't want to use a framework like Angular, ReactJs just for that."

## Production mode:

What are these WebComponents?
- They are pieces of code that you can attach into your html files and append them to your DOM.

What will I be able to do with this?
- You can import pieces of code inside your html files simple by using `<app-sample-tag></app-sample-tag>`
- You'll be able to style them as you wish, like you were running an Angular 6 application

And the best part, it's small, easy to understand and flexible as you want it to be
